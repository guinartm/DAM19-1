# Assignment: Decision Making
___
### Task:    

● Clients complain that the searches for a destinations sometimes fail. Head of product decided to address
the issue, and ask development team to work on fix.

● The team committed to work out the solution during August. It was agreed that the team’s bonus payout
would depend on effectiveness of the solution.

● The Head of Product ask you to analyze the data and help him to decide whether the team deserve
the bonus?

● Your answer should be documented and submitted to the GitHub so that any changes can be easily
tracked.

### Useful context:

● Data for Barcelona destination (18452212) is representative so that any conclusions can be extrapolated
for other destinations.

## Pre Data Analysis

1. We noted that some of the last files in the August database belong to September, so we decided to place this files in the corresponding database.

2. We observed a large number of query/errors during August 18th which could mean that there is an error in the database. However, for our current analysis, we assume that the data is correct.

## Data Visualization

1. We print a Boxplot of the queries_error in our database for a visual Analysis.

````
> library(readxl)
> Data1 <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Data1.xlsx")
> View(Data1)
> boxplot(error~month, data = Data1, at = c(1, 2), names = c("August", "September"), horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE)
````

## Statistical Analysis

1. Given that Boxplots displays a slight difference between August and September, it is proposed to perform a confirmatory data analisis trough a statistical hypothesis testing.

For this case we define: 

	Null hypothesis H0 = queries_error August
	Alternative hypothesis H1 = queries_error September as an improvement

2. Regarding the assupmtion that the observations of both groups are statistically independent of each other, data are paired and come from the same population, we opt to run a non parametric test, in order to decide whether to pay the bonus or not. For this case, the Mann-Withney U test (Wilcoxon rank sum test):

````
> wilcox.test(error~month, mu=0,alt="two.sided", correct=TRUE, paired=FALSE, conf.int=TRUE, data = Data1)

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  error by month
W = 3619200, p-value = 7.695e-07
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 2.599664e-06 9.999511e-01
````

*We obtained a P-Value out of the confidence interval*

___

## Conclusion

With the information provided after running the Mann-Withney/Wilcoxon test, we can confirm that the distribution of both samples is not the same. In September, there is statistically a significant decrease in the number of errors compared to August. We decided to reject the nulle hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, so we consider the bonus payment should be made.
